Poke
====

A tiny HTTP to Stomp adapter which I use for putting GitHub post-receive
notifications on to a Stomp destination.

What you do with the notification once it's gone beyond Poke is up to you.

Installing
----------

  # Clone the repository.
  # Install the required gems using bundler.
  # There is no step 3.


Using Poke
----------

Pretty simple really. Run it like this:

    ./bin/poked

By default poked listen on port 8854 and pushes to a Stomp server on
127.0.0.1:61613. See `./bin/poked --help` for options.


Contributing
------------

  # Fork the project.
  # Make your changes. Don't change the version and make sure it's all tested.
  # Document your changes in the README and if necessary in the code.
  # Push to a topic branch.
  # Send a Pull request (by email if you don't use GitHub).
